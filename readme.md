Multiplication and division are performed before addition and subtraction.Powers are
made before multiplication.To avoid confusion we can use parentheses ()
to group expressions.However, maple r does not accept brackets [] and keys {} used
to this end.
Example 1.11 prioritizing operations.
> 2+4*3;
14
> (2+4)*3^2+2;
